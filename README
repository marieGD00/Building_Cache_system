************************

Before running the autograders, compile your code:
    linux> make
    macbook> make

Check the correctness of your simulator:
    linux> ./test-csim
    macbook> ./test-csim-mac

Check everything at once (this is the program that your instructor runs):
    linux> ./driver.py
    macbook> ./driver-mac.py
